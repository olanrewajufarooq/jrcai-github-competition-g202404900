## Reinforcement Learning Control and Analysis

### Overview

This project offers a succinct approach for training, testing, and analyzing a **reinforcement learning (RL) agent in MATLAB**. By providing a structured environment and a set of scripts, it facilitates **reproducible experiments** and **quick exploration of the RL algorithm**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
.
├── src/
│   └── analysis.m
│   └── env_setup.m
│   └── plotResults.m
│   └── testAgent.m
│   └── trainAgent.m
│   └── visualizeDynamics.m
│── data/
│   └── trainedAgent.mat
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

1. **`data/`**  
   Input files or auxiliary data necessary for training or evaluation.  
    - **`trainedAgent.mat`** - A pre-trained RL agent, enabling immediate testing and analysis.  
3. **`src/`**  
   Source scripts and utilities:  
   - **`analysis.m`** – Performs performance evaluations of trained agents.  
   - **`env_setup.m`** – Defines and initializes the RL environment.  
   - **`plotResults.m`** – Visualizes performance metrics and learning curves.  
   - **`testAgent.m`** – Tests the agent’s behavior in the configured environment.  
   - **`trainAgent.m`** – Implements the training procedure for the RL agent.  
   - **`visualizeDynamics.m`** – Displays environment-agent interactions over time.  
4. **`.gitignore`**  
   Specifies files and folders to be excluded from version control.  
5. **`main.m`**  
   A top-level script for running the environment, training agents, and performing preliminary tests.  
6. **`README.md`**  
   This document, outlining the repository structure and usage.

## Usage
1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Run `env_setup.m` to configure environment parameters (e.g., reward function, action space).  
2. **Training**  
   - Execute `trainAgent.m` to train a new RL agent using chosen hyperparameters (Sutton & Barto, 2018).  
3. **Testing**  
   - Use `testAgent.m` to assess the trained agent’s performance under various conditions.  
4. **Analysis**  
   - Leverage `analysis.m` to compute performance metrics and `plotResults.m` for visual summaries.  
5. **Visualization**  
   - Run `visualizeDynamics.m` to observe how the agent interacts with the environment in real time.
